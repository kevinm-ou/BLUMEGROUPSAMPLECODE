# BLUMEGROUPSAMPLECODE
This repository is a set of basic example codes for the Blume Group at OU. It is maintained by Kevin M.
The list of examples are below
1) ScaLapackBandedSolverExample: Getting started with MKL's ScaLapack.
  a)There are three files. 1) A basic explicit example of distributing your matrix in the case of a banded matrix. 2) A basic method of distributing your matrix in the case of a larger band matrix. This one includes timings so it doesn't show the results. Please note the size of distributed matrix must be a above some minimum or it will toss a error. 3) A serial version of example 2.
